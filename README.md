# s3.g8

Mill-based scala3 project template. Includes a starter package, main method and worksheet under the ```src``` directory.

#### Usage in VS Code

From the left sidebar, select ```Metals -> New Project -> Custom (template)``` and enter ```incrementum/s3.g8``` or the full url to the repository. After a few seconds, VS Code will prompt for the project properties and wether to open a new editor window. Select "yes" and the project will start to build. After a little while the worksheet should run the starter code.
